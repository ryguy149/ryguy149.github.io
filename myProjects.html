                            <li>Java Storefront GUI: <br>
                                <sub>This GIU was created with Java Swing and was my final project within my Java development class. 
                                    This is a Storefront GUI that allows the user to see their invoice displayed to the screen or printed to a file after shopping. </sub> <br>

                            <li>C++ Vending Machine Operating System program: <br>
                                <sub>This project was created with a parser and vectors in C++. This program functions through the command line and has a variety of commands that were coded from scratch. </sub>

                            <li>Predicting Emotion with Support Vector Machines Classifier (Python Text Mining): <br>
                                <sub>This was the final project for my text mining class and it builds a Support Vector Machines model to predict emotion. For my final results, 
                                    I was able to reach an emotion prediction accuracy of 67% with the dataset our class worked with.</sub>

                            <li>Wine Preference Prediction script with R programming: <br> 
                                <sub>Based on three simple questions this script will recommend a wine from a database of 130 thousand wines.</sub>

                            <li>Senior Project: Text editor GUI that will predict the emotion of inputted text or text document (WIP):<br>
                                <sub>I created this project within Python with the help of Support Vector Machines and Tkinter. 
                                    Currently, the emotion prediction accuracy is roughly 40%, however, I am currently working on improving 
                                    the accuracy of my program. As far as the functionality it works flawlessly, sentences will be highlighted according 
                                    to the emotion they have present within them. Furthermore, the document will be graded for subjectivity, polarity, and negative and positive feedback.</sub>
